# Presentation Script - AI Jukebox

## Video Presentation (2-3 minutes)

### Scene 1: Introduction (0:00-0:30)
"Hello! I'm [Your Name], and this is AI Jukebox - our submission for the Agentic Commerce on Arc hackathon."

**[Visual: App homepage with hackathon banner]**

"Today I'll show you how autonomous AI agents can make real financial decisions on-chain using Circle products."

### Scene 2: Problem & Solution (0:30-1:00)
"The problem: Traditional content curation relies on human decisions. Our solution: Autonomous agentic commerce."

**[Visual: Before/After comparison]**

"AI Jukebox combines Gemini AI for content creation, autonomous agents for decision-making, and Arc blockchain for settlement."

### Scene 3: Live Demo (1:00-2:00)
"Let me show you how it works..."

**[Action: Generate a song]**
"First, I describe a song. Let's try 'synthwave for night driving'..."

**[Action: Show AI generation]**
"The AI creates a complete song with metadata. Now watch the agent analyze it..."

**[Action: Show agent analysis]**
"The agent gives it an 87/100 score and recommends prioritization."

**[Action: Toggle autonomous mode]**
"In autonomous mode, the agent will automatically process a USDC payment..."

**[Action: Show transaction]**
"0.001 USDC sent, settled on Arc in under a second. The song moves to the priority playlist!"

### Scene 4: Technology & Circle Integration (2:00-2:30)
"This works because of Circle's powerful products:
- Gemini AI for content
- Autonomous agents for decisions
- USDC for payments
- Arc for settlement"

**[Visual: Architecture diagram]**

"We built this in 48 hours using Next.js, TypeScript, and Circle's excellent documentation."

### Scene 5: Conclusion & Call to Action (2:30-3:00)
"AI Jukebox demonstrates the future of agentic commerce. Imagine this scaled to marketplaces, DAOs, and autonomous organizations."

"Try it live at [URL], check our GitHub for code, and let's build the future of autonomous commerce together!"

"Thank you!"

## Slide Presentation (5-10 slides)

### Slide 1: Title
**AI Jukebox - Agentic Commerce on Arc**
- Subtitle: Autonomous AI + USDC + Arc Blockchain
- Your Name & Team
- Hackathon Logo

### Slide 2: The Problem
- Traditional content curation is manual
- Human bias in content selection
- Slow monetization processes
- Limited scalability

### Slide 3: Our Solution
- **Autonomous Agentic Commerce**
- AI-generated content + AI-driven decisions
- On-chain settlement with USDC
- Real-time, trustless operations

### Slide 4: Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind
- **AI**: Google Gemini API
- **Blockchain**: Arc with USDC-native gas
- **Payments**: Circle infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Slide 5: How It Works
1. User describes song → AI generates it
2. Agent analyzes quality → Scores 70-100
3. If score > 80 → Auto-prioritize with USDC
4. Transaction settles on Arc → Song prioritized

### Slide 6: Circle Integration
- **Arc Blockchain**: Settlement layer
- **USDC**: Payment & gas token
- **Key Benefits**:
  - EVM compatibility
  - Sub-second finality
  - Stable transaction costs
  - Enterprise reliability

### Slide 7: Live Demo Screenshots
- Generation interface
- Agent analysis panel
- Transaction confirmation
- Priority playlist

### Slide 8: Business Impact
